### 10. Generating a Payroll 
Before generating a payroll, you must create several data first. The first thing you must do is create an employee base salary. You can go to Settings > Payroll > Employee Base Salaries ![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fOPWlFjU8Q1jWS9MV4fpGzLOpRHUk8D2)   
![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=16Mipu30cVEWILW509aw0RXJ7JKqT4N1Q)   

The thing you must note is salary has 3 types. Monthly means, the payroll will generate based on 1 month. So if you select the date in payroll later that has a total of 2 months. That means employees have 2 times their salary from the current amount. 
The second type is Daily. This type will be related to the total employee present in attendance. So when the employee did 5 times attendance, that means the employee has 4 times the salary from the current amount.
The third type is Hourly. Same with Daily, but this will use the total work hours of attendance that the employee doing. The employee will have total Hourly work hours * current amount as base salary.

After creating an employee base salary, you may want to create a custom component. You can go to Settings > Payroll > Payroll Components. And you will see the default component named "Potongan Terlambat". When you click edit, you will see the modal popup and you can update the configuration. Late tolerance means if the total late in each attendance of an employee is greater than this late tolerance, the employee will get this deduction when payroll is generated.

You also can make your custom component by click Add Component Button and you can decide the customization based on your needs.

To make the amount of each component you can click the set value button and you will be directed to Setting Value Component Page. Here you can choose if you want this component applied to all employees in the branch. Go to the branch tab, but if you want this component applied only to several employees go to the Employee tab. Click the dot icon and edit button, and the modal will appear. You can insert the amount and switch the status to active to make the component applied in payroll later.

![image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1h-xqVdlRFVb3pakzipkC-t14Qeh5rSt5) 

Finally, go to Payroll > Run Payroll. You can click generate payroll, and input the date you want to generate payroll and which branch. Just wait and the system will automatically generate payroll for you based on your configuration before. Just for note, payroll will not appear in API if you did not change the status to Paid. Click the show button, and click the button paid all in detail slippage. Fill in the date and all the payroll will change status to paid.
